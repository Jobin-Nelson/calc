# Calc

A calculator that is written in Rust using [Shunting Yard Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting_yard_algorithm)

It is a parsing technique that outputs [Reverse Polish Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation) from [Infix Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation), which makes calculations easy with operator-precedence
